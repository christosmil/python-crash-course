# Python Crash Course, Eric Matthes, 2nd Edition, No Starch Press

($$1 min.$$ read)

This repo contains the examples and the exercises solutions of the [Python Crash Course](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/regular_index/). Careful! The book I used is the second edition, whereas currently (2023) the book is in its third edition.

The directory `/res` contains the resources. These include i) all the hyperlinks used in the book, organized per chapter; and ii) the cheat sheets provided by the author.

The directory `/src` contains the source codes. These include i) all the examples (***not*** copy-pasted); ii) all the exercises solutions[^1]; and iii) all the listings from the cheat sheets. I cross-checked the exercises solutions with the author's solutions.

I developed and tested the programs using the Sublime Text 3 editor in a Windows 11 workstation with Python 3.8.3, a Windows 10 workstation with Python 3.11.1, and an Ubuntu 22.04 workstation with Python 3.10.12.

[^1]: I did not implement exercise 20.4, because Heroku had no longer a free tier and the error pages were developed differently in the proposed Platform.sh, which is also used in the third edition of the book.
